# Arduino-Sketches

Hello folks. These are list of Arduino sketches which I have created. 


1) Script to connect NodeMCU to a Wifi network (nodemcuwifi.ino)

I tried a lot of sketches from the internet to connect a NodeMCU to a wifi network. But was not satisfied. So I created this sketch which connects a NodeMCU to wifi network in more intuitive way. When uploaded it will display a list of available Access points to connect with the strength of each access point also displaying the band of the access point (2.4 GHz/5 GHz).

When connection to a access point is successful
